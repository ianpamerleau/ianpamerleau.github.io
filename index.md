I am a third year PhD student in the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Science Department at Purdue University. I work with Dr. Mike Sori on icy geophysics in the outer solar system, currently looking at Ceres and Callisto. I use the finite element method and geologic mapping to simulate solid state flow over billions of years, be it viscous relaxation of surface features or convection deeper down. My work aims to uncover the internal structure and the state of differentiation of these icy worlds. 

I received my B.S. in Geology and Mathematics with a minor in physics from the University of Pittsburgh in 2021. In my courses, I discovered my love of the physics behind the evolution of surface features like waves and rivers. I conducted my first research project on conjugate wave flow analysis, but my larger project at Pitt was helping to develop an automated floodplain delineation algorithm. Through these projects, I learned the basics of grant writing, coding, and how to conduct research. 

In my free time, I fence (like with swords)! I also play the saxophone and guitar.
